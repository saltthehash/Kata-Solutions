# Kata-Solutions
My solutions from the Kata coding challenges from CodeWars: https://codewars.com/

The problems (called kata) posted on codewars include various types of coding challenges. Many kata involve the implementation of complex algorithms.

## Training Manual
From https://www.codewars.com/about:

###Kata
In our dojo, kata are real code challenges focused on improving skill and technique. Some train programming fundamentals, while others focus on complex problem solving. Each kata is crafted for and by the community.

###Kyu/Dan Ranks
Each kata on the site is set to a Kyu/Dan rank, based on its subject area and difficulty. The community collectively determines rank in the Beta Process.

###Earning Ranks
You can advance through the ranks by completing kata at or above your rank - the harder the kata the faster you advance.

###Honor
Honor represents the level of respect a user has earned from the community, based on their skill and contributions. Honor is earned fastest through creating kata, crafting great solutions, and constructive comments.
